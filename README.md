*** Twitter API 1.1 Examples ***

This class is not meant to be a usable library or module, but a guide for how to construct, sign and make requests to the Twitter 1.1 API. 

It is overly verbose and repetitive on purpose, in order to make cutting and pasting easier for those wishing to create their own API interaction, rather than rely on a 3rd party library.

You can freely use, fork and redistribute this repository at will. But know I offer no guarantee or warranty for it. You're on your own for that.
